        <h3>What Applications into Other Fields Does this Career Have?</h3>
        <p> Since Cybersecurity engineering consists of creating and regulating prevention systems to protect software and networks from cyber threats, other fields that are similar to this career are :</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cybersecurity Analyst </li>
            <li>Penetration Tester</li>
            <li>Cyber Security consultant</li>
            <li>Security Engineer</li>
            <li>Ethical hacke</li>
            <li>Forensics</li>
           
        </ul>

        <h3>What Other Interesting Information About the Field Did You Learn?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is one of those fields that is always evolving. Their work revolves around the core of CIA Triad, incorporates encryptions which is a cutting-edge technology, and detection systems that are AI-driven. Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting information in our digital world, with costs of cybercrime projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Phishing remains the most common attack method, while AI is increasingly used to enhance defense mechanisms. The first computer virus, the "Creeper," emerged in the 1970s, and major breaches like Yahoo's in 2013 have exposed billions of user accounts. Despite rising threats, there is a significant shortage of cybersecurity professionals, with an estimated 3.5 million unfilled jobs by 2025.</p>


        <h3>How Will Artificial Intelligence Affect This Field?</h3>
        <p>AI will significantly impact cybersecurity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI can enhance cybersecurity by automating threat detection and response, analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of cyber threats. It can predict and mitigate potential attacks before they occur and improve the accuracy and speed of detecting breaches. AI-driven tools can also assist in managing and prioritizing security alerts, reducing the burden on human analysts and allowing for a more efficient and proactive approach to cybersecurity. Cybercriminals can leverage AI to develop more sophisticated and harder-to-detect attacks, such as advanced phishing schemes, automated hacking, and the creation of polymorphic malware that changes its code to avoid detection. AI can also be used to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities more quickly than ever before.</p>
